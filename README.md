# Easy Learn - Markdown Tutorial

**Markdown is a mark-up language similar to the _html_. It is used to style text on the web. By making use of the markdown language, a simple text can be made appealing for the end user. Using markdown, we can format the words as bold, italics or strike through, add images as we add in html, add hyperlinks to follow through, add colours (Just kidding it is not Microsoft word or paint to playthrough be serious guys ) etc. I call it is FUS (Format Using Symbols)**

It is a year long process to learn Markdown, take a :coffee: break. Just kidding :laughing:. Almost forgot to say :sleeping_bed: markdown files are the files with the extension .md or .markdown.



## Headers :arrow_down_small:

<!--- Header formatting - As of Header formatting in markdown is considered we can use the pound symbol for different types of header. One pound (# followed by heading) refers the header 1 (similar to html i only meant the h1 not the symbol # ), two pound symbols for the second one and it goes of. Upto six headers are available (###### [name] -->



> #### Syntax For Header

```
Space between the hash symbol and the header is mandatory. Indentation will leads to unformatted header

# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

#### Header 4

##### Header 5

###### Header 6

Alternative way for header formatting using - and =

### Header 3

#### Header 4

##### Header 5

Now, It is clear that header formatting is done with help one symbol #. Forgot to mention about the alternate way using dash and equals symbol



First :coffee: Break


## Emphasis :arrow_down_small:

<!-- Text formatting such as emphasis or italic, bold, strikethrough etc. can be done with the help of three symbols. They are dash - , ~ tilde and asterisk *. Single underscore/asterisk at start and end of any word or group of words will format it as italic. Double underscore/asterisk at start and end of any word or group of words will result in strong formatting (bold formatting). Two tilde's will result in strike through. Space is always a factor here. Misplaced symbols may result in improper formatting -->



> #### Syntax for Italics

```
_Emphasis of group of words using single dash_
*Emphasis of group of words using single asterisk*
* Emphasis of group of words using single asterisk *
_ Emphasis of group of words using singe dash _
```

> #### Markdown Preview for Italics

_Emphasis of group of words using single dash_

*Emphasis of group of words using single asterisk*

---

`space factor`

Emphasis of group of words using single asterisk *

_ Emphasis of group of words using singe dash _

> #### Syntax for Strong

```
__Making strong or bold formatting using double underscore__

**Making strong or bold formatting using double asterisk**

__ Making strong or bold formatting using double underscore __

** Making strong or bold formatting using double asterisk **
```

>  #### Markdown Preview for Strong

__Making strong or bold formatting using double underscore__

**Making strong or bold formatting using double asterisk** 

---

`space factor`

__ Making strong or bold formatting using double underscore __

** Making strong or bold formatting using double asterisk **

---

> #### Syntax for Strikethrough

```
~~This is how you can strikethrough texts using tilde~~

~~ Dont give any space after tilde symbol ~~
```

> #### Markdown Preview for Strikethrough

~~This is how you can strikethrough texts using tilde~~

---

`space factor`

~~ Don't give any space after tilde symbol ~~

* Now, we can play with these three symbols trying all the possibilities such as bold inside italic, strikethrough inside italic/strong etc. You name it :muscle:

```
_this is me. **This is always me**. ~~Being along~~_
```

_this is me. **This is always me**. ~~Being along~~_

Oh, it is possible then. :crossed_fingers:

* The second guess

```
~~oh god *why* i am __screwing__ like this~~
```

~~oh god *why* i am __screwing__ like this~~

Its done. :laughing:

Emphasis in markdown can be done with the help of three symbols *, _ and ~. Spacing between the symbol and texts result in improper formatting.  Combined Emphasis with bold, strikethrough and underscore is possible in markdown making it more user friendly.


Second :coffee: Break


> ## Lists :arrow_down_small:

<!-- List formatting is another interesting feature supported by markdown. List formatting can be done with the help of symbols as well as numbers. Sub points or the so called sub lists can also be done in markdown. -->

#### Unordered List :black_nib:

> #### Syntax for Unordered List

```
Using *,

* My List Item1
* My List Item2 
* My List Item3

Alternative way,

- My List Item1
- My List Item2
- My List Item3

And another alternative way,

+ My List Item1
+ My List Item2 
+ My List Item3

For Sub-lists from parent lists:

* My List Item1
  - My sublist Item1
      + Sub-sub list Item1
  
Space Factor

*My List Item1
*My List Item2 
*My List Item3
```



> #### Markdown Preview for Unordered Lists

Using *,

* My List Item1
* My List Item2 
* My List Item3

Alternative way,

- My List Item1
- My List Item2
- My List Item3

And another alternative way,

+ My List Item1
+ My List Item2 
+ My List Item3

For Sub-lists from parent lists:

* My List Item1
  - My sub-list Item1
    + Sub-sub list Item1

---

`Space Factor`

*My List Item1

*My List Item2 

*My List Item3

----

Unordered list in markdown have only one possibility that is the bullet points. For sub-lists put two spaces over the parent bullet point and start the list with a new list. The symbols used here are `*, + and -`

#### Ordered List :black_nib:

> #### Syntax for Ordered List

```
Using number 1,

1. My List Item1
1. My List Item2
1. My List Item3

Using different numbers,

1. My List Item1
3. My List Item2
9. My List Item3

Sub-list,

1. My List Item1
2. My List Item2
    1. My sublist Item1
  	  1. My Sub-sub list Item1

space factor

1.My List Item1
1.My List Item2
1.My List Item3
```

Using number 1,

1. My List Item1

1. My List Item3

Using different numbers,

2. My List Item2
3. My List Item3

Sub-list,

Ordered List in markdown file can be created with the help of number followed by a dot. It is not mandatory that the number should be sorted . It just need a number that's it.

$-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a$
